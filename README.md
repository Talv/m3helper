# m3helper

Small utility tool that finds textures associated with an *M3 model*. And optionally exports them to selected directory.\
It was primarly made to streamline the process of extracting *Heroes of the Storm* models. It cannot browse CASC archives however - all necessary files must be extracted beforehand.

It's possible that it will grow in features such as:

- [ ] XML export/import with an use of https://github.com/flo/m3addon
- [ ] Non-disruptive editing of basic model properties - model/material flags
